This directory contains two set of images to be used in the calibration
process. These images were extracted from imagenet, ILSVRC2012, which are in
jpeg format and were converted to png format by changing them from BGR to RGB
and resizing them to 224x224 in the images224 folder or to 299x299 in the
images299. A program file called jpg2png.cpp and its CmakeList.txt was included
to help in this conversion. To compile it, just do:

mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
mv jpg2png ..

Usage:

jpg2png path/to/original/jpeg/image path/to/save/png/image size

where size is 224 or 299.
